contribute to l18n
==================

If you are reading this, you're interested in contributing to l18n.
Great news!

2 main ways to contribute:

   - add features or fix bugs
   - add languages

This document will cover mainly the 2nd way. For the 1st way, that's easy: just
dive into the code, the tests, and create a pull request. You may want to
read the tests/_README.rst file.


Adding a language
-----------------

Adding a language to ``l18n`` is relatively easy but requires a little bit of
work for one simple reason: the CLDR_ provides translation for many timezones
defined in pytz_ (which come from the `Olson database`_), but not all of them.
Indeed, there are a few of them that are missing or not very accurate, and that
require a little bit of manual work.


Step 0: how the translation files generation works
..................................................

The translation files, as well as a ``__maps.py`` module, are generated by a
dedicated python package, which is located in the ``maker`` directory of this
repository. It has one entry point: ``build``.

Calling ``build`` does 3 things:

- it fetches the relevant pages from the CLDR_ website and extracts the needed
  translations
- it retrieves missing or more precise translations from locale files in the
  ``overrides`` directory
- it generates the translation files and the ``__maps`` module.

After the build, a distribution can be created and uploaded to pypi_.


Step 1: adding the language to the maker's settings
...................................................

To make ``l18n_maker`` fetch the translations for a language from the CLDR
website, simply add the language to ``l18n_maker.settings.LOCALES`` tuple.

I told you it was simple ...


Step 2: adding a translations overrides file
............................................

The timezones for which no translation can be found in the CLDR are listed in
the file ``overrides/root``. This file provides the mappings for fallback
translations. Some of the entries may not change in your language, some are
likely to be different.

You need to:

- copy ``overrides/root`` to ``overrides/your_language``
- remove each line of ``overrides/your_language`` for which the name in your
  language is the same compared to the fallback one
- edit each line of ``overrides/your_language`` for which the name in your
  language is different from the fallback one. It may require a few Google
  searches!

You can have a look at the existing files for examples in other languages.


Step 4: building the translation files
......................................

To build the translation files, you need to go into the package's main
directory and run the following commands::

   python bootstrap.py       # this creates the 'bin/buildout' script
   bin/buildout parts=build  # this creates the 'bin/build' script
   bin/build                 # this generates the files

You can have a look at the output, which will notify you if:

- A translation was not found for a timezone or territory: this is an issue
  that must be reported and fixed asap.
- A translation was found both in the CLDR and in a ``overrides/*`` file: this
  is normal in case a CLDR translation was not satisfying (e.g for the
  'Pacific/Easter' timezone that is translated to 'Easter' while it should be
  'Easter Island') and needed to be overriden.


Step 5: checking that everything is ok
......................................

You may want to open the generated ``locale/your_language/LC_MESSAGES/l18n.po``
with an editor such as poedit_ to check that the translations have been
correctly generated. You may also spot some incorrect / imprecise translations
(e.g like 'Easter Island' mentionned above). In that case, you can override
the CLDR translation by providing an entry in the ``overrides/your_language``
file.


Step 6: Add your name to the contributors list
..............................................

So that you can easily be contacted when there is a line to add to
``overrides/your_language``, for example when pytz is updated. Just add the
language and a way to contact you.


Step 7: Increase maintenance version number and create a pull request
.....................................................................

You just need to increment the 3rd number of the version (as the major and
minor must match pytz's version) before creating a pull request.
